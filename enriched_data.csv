It directly states that glial cells are much lower resolution and slower than neurons. When I say janitorial work, I mean the complicated task of homeostasis that enables neurons to work even in quite literally apocalyptic conditions, and even recover from them. Because janitorial work is hard.and having a clean space is essential for good work.  The major problem with your impassioned promotion of glial cells is that neurons can still just do their jobs without them. You can culture neurons without glial cells and they work. They can play doom. Glial cells can‚Äôt play doom. The neurons are doing the informational heavy lifting, factually.  I think you‚Äôre mostly just pissed that I‚Äôm flippant about your pet interest and I don‚Äôt really care enough to do a deep dive into how the apocalypse janitor does his job.  Mostly because the apocalypse janitor‚Äôs job is very hard because if he fucks up his job you starve to death or have a seizure or some other horrible thing that results from being made of goo with very little resources to do your job. Which isn‚Äôt a problem for code. You can just teleport signals around in code without worrying about wasting energy and decaying myelin sheathes and weird waste products needing to be managed from sending the signal and so on and so forth.   You can just bundle all the signaling needs you have in a neat bouquet of feedback connections and throw an optimizer at it. Glial cells in the sense you‚Äôre describing would just be, additional connections moving error and information around. Enormously helpful when we can turn glial behavior into algorithmic insights, extremely complicated implementation details until then.  Please use a different word than supervenes because your question is not clear about what part of the process you‚Äôre talking about.

Apparently the doctor assumed she was on it for her weight without actually checking, and just decided she couldn\'t have it. They seem to really have a particular issue with American meds.   In one of those ""neuro divergent people stick together"" situations, I believe I also have ADHD and possibly autism, but I\'m extremely reluctant to try and get a diagnosis at the moment. I *also* know one of the psychiatrists for my council area, and a couple of years ago at lunch she treated several of our friend group to a long, bitter rant about how annoying it is that all these adults ""spend too much time on tiktok and think they have ADHD now"" and how it\'s a waste of her time dealing with it. It\'s given me the strong impression that they\'re just denying most people based on their prejudice on the subject. Plus, my parents were also very resistant to the idea for a long time, so until very recently, I knew I\'d fail the childhood portion of the screening. Recently my mum\'s changed it up to, ""We never knew about this when you were kids! And anyway, from your description they\'d probably diagnose *me* as autistic!"" Funny she\'d mention that... It\'s also weird that my dad is late for everything and likes to suddenly decide to do things like rearrange the attic at 2am, but they both insist I\'m being silly and they\'re clearly completely normal. I think denial about themselves, as much as their children, is what holds up most of these older parents. It\'s extremely frustrating!  I may give getting a diagnosis a try soon.  I also realised that I should so something about this stuff because of my kids- easy to ignore your issues with sudden loud noises or being on time for things when you\'re on your own, harder when kids are around. I also would like to test the waters, because we believe our eldest might have inherited a wee touch of the neurospiciness from me, but as they\'re also trans, we\'re reluctant to go ahead with screening while they\'re doing fine in school, because the greater worry for us is that it\'d be weaponised against them.

The two RCA inputs (Line 1 and Line 2) are not isolated from each other. This means that if signals are playing simultaneously on the two sources, then they\'ll come through together.

{'2025-08-21T08:34:13Z,"Here as someone who didn\'t *hate* but really disliked Onyx storm to give my perspective.   >Honestly, I think many who complained about OS just didn‚Äôt pay that much attention to the other two books and probably only read them for the hype, already with a bias to hate them in mind.  I did pay attention to the other two books and LOVED them. I was super confused when so many people said they didn\'t like Iron Flame honestly. And... I don\'t think people not liking Onyx Storm means ""many"" of them were only reading for hype.    >how Xaden should be evil and that it breaks the lore that he isn‚Äôt  I understand this take. They keep going on and on about how dangerous Xaden is becoming but we don\'t see much apart from him becoming more obsessive and possessive and loosing control more. I guess people wanted more stakes, and that\'s understandable. It felt empty in a way.   >Or the complaint that OS is just ‚Äúboring‚Äù and ‚Äúnothing happens.‚Äù Like, yeah, if you don‚Äôt care about the story and don‚Äôt pay attention to what‚Äôs actually happening, I‚Äôm sure it feels boring or confusing.  Hell no. Onyx Storm was definitely boring in some areas and interesting in others. Nothing happens? I agree. In terms of overall plot, all they do is bounce from Isle to Isle and have more or less the same format happen, and nothing really changes in terms of how close Violet is to curing Xaden, and them getting allies for the war. Sure, smaller individual interesting things happen, but in terms of overall plot, it can be considered boring.  I DO care about the story and what\'s happening and let me mention again, I LOVED the last two books. So yeah, I don\'t like how we\'re boiling a difference in opinion down to ""Yeah you didn\'t care about the story and didn\'t pay attention"".  >And now that it‚Äôs bigger, the new complaint is that it‚Äôs boring because ‚Äúnothing happens and they are just going places‚Äù  Yeah, that\'s the complaint. Genuine question here, do you only read fantasy romance, or do you read just fantasy books too? And, just because the world is being expanded doesn\'t mean its being done in the best or most interesting way, so it can still be boring. Not to mention the tropes. It would be boring if you have read things before this that are similar to things you have seen before, which is also part of the reason I found it boring, hut I don\'t hold it against Rebecca that much.  >But they‚Äôll be back for books 4 and 5, and they‚Äôll  HELL YES I WILL, with the hope that these two books will be better. Regardless of my feelings on Onyx Storm, I still love the series.  >and they‚Äôll complain just as much, without any real intent of caring about the story or the lore  And why does someone having a different opinion to you mean they don\'t care about the story or lore?  >There are plot holes and valid criticisms of the books.

You don‚Äôt need to use all the products you listed every night (that would be too much and cause your skin to breakout).  I‚Äôd suggest try working in a peptide serum like The Hydrolift from Root + Renew (I\'m 39 and this is one that i use) it‚Äôs packed with a multi-peptide complex, hyaluronic acid, and soothing plant extracts like ginkgo leaf and aloe. It‚Äôs designed to hydrate, smooth fine lines, and strengthen your skin barrier without causing breakouts.  Other great peptide-based or barrier-supporting alternatives:  \\- Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer ‚Äì affordable, lightweight, great for sensitive or acne-prone skin.  \\- The Inkey List Omega Water Cream ‚Äì super light, nice for layering with actives, and keeps skin calm.  \\- NIOD Copper Amino Isolate Serum 2:1 ‚Äì more of a splurge, but amazing for overall skin health and resilience.  Then 2‚Äì3x/week (not the same night as peptides), you can rotate in a BHA (like your Paula‚Äôs Choice) or a gentle AHA like mandelic acid to keep pores clear and skin smooth.  The key is to not overload your routine, let each active have its night to shine.

{'2025-08-21T08:34:19Z,"Mein Zweites negativ Erlebnis hatte ich mit 17 . Meine damalige Freundin und heutige Ehefrau hatte dunkelblonde Taillenlange Haare bei unserem Kennenlernen . Im September des gleichen Jahres war sie am Wochenende bei Ihrer Freundin zu Besuch und M√§delsabend machen .Zu diesem Zeitpunkt wusste sie , da√ü ich total vernarrt war in Ihr Haar und freute sich √ºber die Komplimente meinerseits sowie von aussenstehenden Menschen . Da meine Freundin meist einen Bolero trug waren die langen Haare meist darunter versteckt . So auch an diesem Sonntag als wir uns Nachmittags trafen . Wie immer gingen wir aufeinander zu , k√ºssten uns und meine H√§nde gingen in ihren Nacken damit ich ihr Haar aus dem Bolero ziehen konnte . Doch dann stockte mir der Atem , als nach 10 Zentimetern kein Haar mehr √ºber meine Finger glitt . Bist du mir jetzt b√∂se,  war die furchtbarste Frage die sie mir dann stellte . Viele werden jetzt lachen aber ich fing an zu heulen , weil ich es nicht fassen konnte . Im gleichen Moment kamen die Bilder von Steffi wieder bei mir hoch . Ich verstand die Welt nicht mehr und verabschiedete mich bis zum anderen Tag von ihr und ging  mit tr√§nenden Augen nach Hause . Am n√§chsten Tag erkl√§rte sie mir dann wie es zu den kurzen Haaren kam . Sie waren zu viert an dem Abend und zwei von Ihnen kamen dann auf die Idee mit dem Haare schneiden . Nach Aussage meiner Freundin wollten alle sich gegenseitig die Spitzen um 5 Zentimeter k√ºrzen,  was sie dann auch durchgezogen haben . Dann wollte eine noch mal 5 Zentimeter k√ºrzer haben , wenn die anderen mitziehen w√ºrden.  Also machten sie das auch noch . Dann schlug wiederum die andere vor das sich alle vier die gleiche L√§nge schneiden lassen um zu sehen , welche ihr Haar am schnellsten w√§chst . Die k√ºrzesten Haare hatte die beste Freundin meiner Frau . Und nicht als Spielverderber oder Looserin da zu stehen willigte meine Frau auch da ein . Ende vom Lied war das besagte Ergebnis von knapp √ºber der Schulterblattl√§nge. Ich liebte meine Frau nicht wegen ihrer langen Haare aber es fehlte etwas , das war nicht mehr sie , zumal sie ihr Haar immer gepflegt und gehegt hat .

If you mean ""The Earth is flat and there are lizard people"", of course not, but ""JFK assassination was fishy"" is not at all an outlandish take, f.e. famous commie Michael Parenti spoke a bit about it and pushed back anti-conspiracy narratives by Chomsky.   It is simply in the interest of the bourgeoisie to collude with each other.

Doesn\'t mean they drink children\'s blood (or do they??), just a bunch of old farts sitting around a table drinking coffee deciding policy, what story to spread in the media, etc... In fact, I would say leftists point this out way too little. These are very real ways we can glimpse bourgeoisie class solidarity. Look how they fucked Corbyn in the UK. Clearly a completely coordinated smear operation.   Then the bourgeoisie also fight a lot amongst each other, in open war of course, but also with subterfuge, and that\'s how we get these endless rabbit hole events, like JFK, Watergate, Epstein scandal. Then there was their fight against communism in the cold war and all the really dark shit associated with this, all the coups, Gladio, MKUltra ,etc. I wonder how can you be a leftist and not a conspiracy theorist?  Finally, there is the real shizo shit which is kinda in the middle between a 100% confirmed conspiracy like Operation Condor and 100% fantasy like lizard people. I am mainly talking about the idea of secret pedo networks amongst the elite. Will we on the r/trueanon subreddit really say these don\'t exist? We know about Epstein anyway, but I mean stuff like the Franklin scandal. Is it really that outlandish that there are more sexual sadists, pedos and general sickos amongst the elite than the normal population, and, since they have the material means to cover up their actions, these would find each other and form their own little circles?

So if you ever slip or can\'t touch the bottom or get tired, just lay back and catch your breath.      My brother lost almost 60lbs in 6 weeks by doing this.
