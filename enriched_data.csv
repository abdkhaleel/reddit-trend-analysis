2025-08-22T05:33:57Z,"I never understood that argument. Yeah, a lot of early SCP articles were just a spooky thing, and a description of what that spooky thing does. No story, no narrative, just a document talking about a haunted object or creature.   But it's not like the addition of a narrative takes away anything. If anything it just makes it better. I'd get really bored of SCP if all it was just thousands of stale, clinical documents describing spooky things with no narrative at all.   Maybe this sounds conceited of me, but the best explanation I can come up with is that as SCP gets more complex and dense, the more 'simple minded' folk have a hard time wrapping their head around it. It's like, they can read a short document talking about a weird statue that snaps your neck, but they can't digest an hour-long short story, possibly with lots of techno-jargon and more subtle hints about the actual nature of the SCP.",0.03970588235294118,0.505812324929972,"SCP (ORG), SCP (ORG), SCP (ORG), jargon (ORG), SCP (ORG)",2025-08-22T05:47:44Z

When the crime was first reported and when it was reported how quickly the murders happened I had imagined someone coming in in the pitch black of night murdering sleeping people then slipping out. But there were so many elements that could‚Äôve easily spooked him and caused this to go wrong. Kaylee in Maddie‚Äôs bed, Xana awake and ordering food meaning another car/witness on the property, Dylan getting out of her room and yelling, Murphy barking, all the lights on. Plus I remember reports of a neighbor out in his yard and also some sort of underage drinking party in a nearby field being busted by the cops just a couple hours before so cops would‚Äôve been around just a few hours prior. I know it‚Äôs not much solace but the only silver lining is that whatever fantasy the killer had about what this night would‚Äôve felt like for him didn‚Äôt come to fruition with all the different stressors that night.",-0.011538461538461537,0.49230769230769234,"Kaylee (PERSON), Maddie (PERSON), Xana (PERSON), Dylan (PERSON), Murphy (PERSON)",2025-08-22T05:47:49Z

I was a math and science teacher at a title one middle school for 11 years. Our district has a program called the New Arrival Center for kids who sometimes literally just walked across the border. I was struggling with my regular classes and they decided it would be a good idea for me to teach math and science to the New Arrival Center students. Mind you these were students from Mexico, Central America, Viet Nam, France, and Sudan ages 11-16.   Like you I freaked out but was told focus on language skills and work in a little science and math. OK, we made lots of posters and collages to learn English words. The math was OK as most were better than American students and the science was fun. Our district had great support for this program with a formal curriculum. It was fantastic! When those kiddos left after 1 year in the New Arrival Center, they were just as successful as native students in upper grades. What I thought was a nightmare turned out to be a blessing.   Take a deep breath and give yourself a break. Talk with your director of instruction and see what her/his expectations are of these students. You may find it to be one of the better gigs in the school.  As far as quiting now, I don't recommend it. You haven't really given it a chance. I think you are panicked and just want to get out.

In software (SemVer), the dots aren‚Äôt decimal points, they‚Äôre separators for MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Versions are compared left-to-right numerically by each field, so 0.10.0 > 0.9.9 because 10 (minor) is greater than 9. No ‚Äúbad math,‚Äù just different rules than decimals.  Ôøº  This is normal across the industry. Plenty of projects went 1.9 ‚Üí 1.10 and people freaked out the same way back then; it‚Äôs standard versioning, not a math error.  Ôøº  And specifically for openpilot: comma‚Äôs own blog literally says ‚Äúafter 0.9 we welcome you to the 0.10 series.‚Äù They chose to keep major = 0 and bump the minor from 9 to 10, which is exactly how SemVer works during the <1.0 phase.  Ôøº  TL;DR: 0.10 is the next minor after 0.9.x, not ‚Äú0.1‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt need to be ‚Äú0.91‚Äù or ‚Äú0.99‚Äù. The SemVer guidance for the 0.y.z phase is to keep bumping the minor as you iterate, and move to 1.0 when you want to signal maturity.

And that's not even speaking of how the rank system is clearly designed to keep players playing as many matches as possible, with not only regular rank resets and no placement matches, but also the ability to gain ELO with a negative WR, which is how you get 45% WR players in GM after they grind 600 matches.

Check out [Cockatiel Cottage](https://www.cockatielcottage.net/), a comprehensive source on all cockatiel knowledge!  ***  Quick FAQs on basic bird behavior:  Yawning a lot - adjusting the crop. Imagine it being like rubbing your belly after a big meal.  Beak grinding - sign of content and happiness.   Standing on one leg, sometimes puffed up feathers - getting ready to snooze, they'll sleep with the head tucked in their back.  Flapping randomly or madly but not flying - just being a goof!  Bending over, making a squeaky noise and trembling wings - horny bird! Check Cockatiel Cottage for how to deal with hormonal behavior.  Rubbing butt on things - same as above.  Soft eeee sound with head bobbing - baby begging noises. Can mean that they want food/play/nap/reassurance/cuddles. Some older birds will do this too.   Holding the wings away from the body (""heart wings"") - a happy male, likely about to sing to you.  Fully outstretched wings (""big wings"") - possesive, ""the thing I'm standing on is mine"". Sometimes paired with hanging upside down (""batbird"") - that's also just being a goof.  Fluffing feathers, bending in weird poses with open wings - wants a bath!  Sneezing - normal (unless excessive), especially after scratching their heads and picking their nose (yes, they do that).  ***  Additionally, check out these resources:   There are lots of toys and foraging opportunities that you can make from cardboard, toilet paper tubes, foliage from your yard (check the species for toxicity [here](https://birdhism.com/blogs/news/common-bird-safe-house-plants) and [here](https://mdvaden.com/bird_page.shtml)).

But let‚Äôs be real: there is no actual path to paying this off if you're already struggling. None. Your payments won‚Äôt even touch the interest, and that unpaid interest will get tacked onto your principal and snowball into an even bigger mountain of debt. Your balance will go *up*, not down. It‚Äôs not just predatory, it‚Äôs legalized usury, plain and simple.  And forget about forgiveness. That‚Äôs about as realistic as this country ever implementing universal healthcare. Why do you think they‚Äôre pumping record funding into ""Cop City"" projects and expanding ICE with budgets that dwarf the military spending of entire nations? You really think that‚Äôs about ‚Äúillegals‚Äù and crime and safety? No dude, it‚Äôs about laying the groundwork for a domestic police state to suppress unrest when the economic screws turn too tight. And guess what? Those screws are tightening. Student loan debt is at historic highs, and the default wave is coming.  Right now, your only real goal should be survival. Get on an income-driven plan if you can. If the payment‚Äôs still too high, just pay *something,* anything, to avoid default. It won‚Äôt stop the interest from piling up, but at least it might buy you some time. Maybe if things improve and you land a better-paying job that lets you make larger payments to keep the balance from exploding.

2025-08-22T05:34:14Z,"Would you say this to yourself if you were 1-2 levels below your current position? I think not everyone cares to continually progress in their own career (they are happy at their current level). But if you are at a very low level and want to take on more responsibility, but can‚Äôt because of hiring freezes, lack of competitions for that level etc‚Ä¶ then you might feel frustrated with your career situation. Some might see their identity as having a desire to contribute to the world/community/workplace in a certain way. If you feel stifled by the opportunities available to you, and unable to work at the level you want, then it can be frustrating.  Most people I have seen that feel that their job and identities are intertwined are not necessarily concerned about AI. The ‚Äúconcerned about AI‚Äù group is most likely concerned they will lose their job (source of income), not that a source of their identity is about to disappear. People are rightly allowed to be skeptical if their livelihood is under threat.  I think you touched on a few facets of attitudes in the workplace. One thing I see as true is that we are constantly being expected to get training (respect in the workplace, job-specific continuing education). Some of that makes sense- if you don‚Äôt keep reinforcing values like respect towards coworkers then you might lose that workplace cultural norm over time. But for some of my colleagues that have 20+ years of experience in the same position, I think they do run out of training to have in their annual performance agreements. As long as they are working at the expected level (and hopefully passing on knowledge to newer employees) I don‚Äôt see a problem, to a certain degree. As long as they are open to the position evolving over time.",0.0665816326530612,0.509889455782313,"AI (GPE), AI (ORG)",2025-08-22T05:48:41Z
