Eventually, a subreddit was created dedicated to that shtick.\n\nI'm just pointing out how the subreddit explaining an obvious joke is adjacent to what the original shtick was which is ironic to what your post is implying. \n\n>If I wanted language lessons on Dutch I\u2019m going to a translator and teacher and not John on Reddit.\n\nIf I want an explanation of a dogshit obscure meme, I'm going to John on Reddit, dude. The people over there are so terminally online, I trust that they have a mental database ranging from 20 year old facebook memes to the latest events. Even if it's obvious, I just like looking at the comments and go \"oh hey i was right, lol\"\n\n>I\u2019m just making fun of people on that subreddit because it does like Kanye with the fish stick joke\n\nThinking about it, yeah you're right, there's some low quality posts on there that just seems obvious, though I barely look up that subreddit and just sometimes see some good posts at the home page and think they're neat.

It directly states that glial cells are much lower resolution and slower than neurons. When I say janitorial work, I mean the complicated task of homeostasis that enables neurons to work even in quite literally apocalyptic conditions, and even recover from them. Because janitorial work is hard.and having a clean space is essential for good work.\n\nThe major problem with your impassioned promotion of glial cells is that neurons can still just do their jobs without them. You can culture neurons without glial cells and they work. They can play doom. Glial cells can\u2019t play doom. The neurons are doing the informational heavy lifting, factually.\n\nI think you\u2019re mostly just pissed that I\u2019m flippant about your pet interest and I don\u2019t really care enough to do a deep dive into how the apocalypse janitor does his job.\n\nMostly because the apocalypse janitor\u2019s job is very hard because if he fucks up his job you starve to death or have a seizure or some other horrible thing that results from being made of goo with very little resources to do your job. Which isn\u2019t a problem for code. You can just teleport signals around in code without worrying about wasting energy and decaying myelin sheathes and weird waste products needing to be managed from sending the signal and so on and so forth. \n\nYou can just bundle all the signaling needs you have in a neat bouquet of feedback connections and throw an optimizer at it. Glial cells in the sense you\u2019re describing would just be, additional connections moving error and information around. Enormously helpful when we can turn glial behavior into algorithmic insights, extremely complicated implementation details until then.\n\nPlease use a different word than supervenes because your question is not clear about what part of the process you\u2019re talking about. In physicalism there\u2019s just function, everything happens all at once because that\u2019s the only way physics lets things happen, but I already tried to explain it that way and you\u2019re just repeating your question so something isn\u2019t getting communicated."}

Luckily for her, she and her spouse have private medical care available to them. Especially lucky because there's also been issues with her *diabetes medication,* which is fucking wild. Apparently the doctor assumed she was on it for her weight without actually checking, and just decided she couldn't have it. They seem to really have a particular issue with American meds. \n\nIn one of those \"neuro divergent people stick together\" situations, I believe I also have ADHD and possibly autism, but I'm extremely reluctant to try and get a diagnosis at the moment. I *also* know one of the psychiatrists for my council area, and a couple of years ago at lunch she treated several of our friend group to a long, bitter rant about how annoying it is that all these adults \"spend too much time on tiktok and think they have ADHD now\" and how it's a waste of her time dealing with it. It's given me the strong impression that they're just denying most people based on their prejudice on the subject. Plus, my parents were also very resistant to the idea for a long time, so until very recently, I knew I'd fail the childhood portion of the screening. Recently my mum's changed it up to, \"We never knew about this when you were kids! And anyway, from your description they'd probably diagnose *me* as autistic!\" Funny she'd mention that... It's also weird that my dad is late for everything and likes to suddenly decide to do things like rearrange the attic at 2am, but they both insist I'm being silly and they're clearly completely normal. I think denial about themselves, as much as their children, is what holds up most of these older parents. It's extremely frustrating!\n\nI may give getting a diagnosis a try soon.  I also realised that I should so something about this stuff because of my kids- easy to ignore your issues with sudden loud noises or being on time for things when you're on your own, harder when kids are around. I also would like to test the waters, because we believe our eldest might have inherited a wee touch of the neurospiciness from me, but as they're also trans, we're reluctant to go ahead with screening while they're doing fine in school, because the greater worry for us is that it'd be weaponised against them. It's a horrible balance right now."}

With some careful set up they can be made to sound much better than there boom and tizz out-of-the-box performance. However, they do have some limitations when it comes to inputs. \n\nThe two RCA inputs (Line 1 and Line 2) are not isolated from each other. This means that if signals are playing simultaneously on the two sources, then they'll come through together. It can also lead to problems with signal noise. If the sockets aren't isolated, *as we know they are not*, then that also means a source signal from one device is getting to the speakers, but also leaking out to the other source. \n\nI suspect this is also the case with the optical signal which is how you'd connect the Bravia OLED. \n\nAt the very minimum, you're going to have to make sure that there's only one source switched on at any one time. Beyond that, it's going to be trial and error whether you can get away with leaving those sources connected, of if you have to go as far as unplugging one whilst using the other. \n\nGood luck."}

I was super confused when so many people said they didn't like Iron Flame honestly. And... I don't think people not liking Onyx Storm means \"many\" of them were only reading for hype. \n\n\n>how Xaden should be evil and that it breaks the lore that he isn\u2019t\n\nI understand this take. They keep going on and on about how dangerous Xaden is becoming but we don't see much apart from him becoming more obsessive and possessive and loosing control more. I guess people wanted more stakes, and that's understandable. It felt empty in a way. \n\n>Or the complaint that OS is just \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cnothing happens.\u201d Like, yeah, if you don\u2019t care about the story and don\u2019t pay attention to what\u2019s actually happening, I\u2019m sure it feels boring or confusing.\n\nHell no. Onyx Storm was definitely boring in some areas and interesting in others. Nothing happens? I agree. In terms of overall plot, all they do is bounce from Isle to Isle and have more or less the same format happen, and nothing really changes in terms of how close Violet is to curing Xaden, and them getting allies for the war. Sure, smaller individual interesting things happen, but in terms of overall plot, it can be considered boring.\n\nI DO care about the story and what's happening and let me mention again, I LOVED the last two books. So yeah, I don't like how we're boiling a difference in opinion down to \"Yeah you didn't care about the story and didn't pay attention\".\n\n>And now that it\u2019s bigger, the new complaint is that it\u2019s boring because \u201cnothing happens and they are just going places\u201d\n\nYeah, that's the complaint. Genuine question here, do you only read fantasy romance, or do you read just fantasy books too? And, just because the world is being expanded doesn't mean its being done in the best or most interesting way, so it can still be boring. Not to mention the tropes. It would be boring if you have read things before this that are similar to things you have seen before, which is also part of the reason I found it boring, hut I don't hold it against Rebecca that much.\n\n>But they\u2019ll be back for books 4 and 5, and they\u2019ll\n\nHELL YES I WILL, with the hope that these two books will be better. Regardless of my feelings on Onyx Storm, I still love the series.\n\n>and they\u2019ll complain just as much, without any real intent of caring about the story or the lore\n\nAnd why does someone having a different opinion to you mean they don't care about the story or lore?\n\n>There are plot holes and valid criticisms of the books. But you\u2019ll never see those from a hater.\n\nThen you must expand your current social space because I definitely have seen many valid criticisms against Onyx Storm. Simultaneously I have seen many valid defences.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's mostly subjective."}

I imagine, based on the fact they're posting, that the conversation has already been had and failed. Gender needs to come out of the equation because OP's partner isn't listening when it was part of the equation.\n\nWhat I take issue with is your reasoning of why -- OP shouldn't have to do emotional labor to manage their partner's dysphoria, and presenting an emotional labor reason as the reason to do the thing does not sit right with me."}

You\u2019re right though, core work is a bit light, planks and knee raises are good, but you might add more variety like dead bugs, hollow holds, or even some rotational work like Russian twists with a dumbbell. Mixing up the rep schemes every few weeks can keep things progressing, and don\u2019t hesitate to swap in unilateral moves or tempo work to hit weak spots.\n\nA common issue is figuring out progression and knowing when to up the weight or reps, especially at home. Tracking your lifts consistently and having a structured progression plan (like adding a rep every session or increasing weight every other week) can make a big difference. I\u2019ve struggled with routine tweaks too, so I started using STRONGR to handle progression, track workouts, and suggest weekly changes based on my equipment and progress. It makes keeping things fresh a lot easier and takes away the guesswork. If you stay consistent and adjust your plan as you get stronger, you\u2019ll keep making gains."}

There are some great alt options out there, especially if you're already doing Vitamin C in the AM. For PM, I\u2019d focus on peptides + gentle exfoliation a few times a week, especially since you still get breakouts. You don\u2019t need to use all the products you listed every night (that would be too much and cause your skin to breakout).  I\u2019d suggest try working in a peptide serum like The Hydrolift from Root + Renew (I'm 39 and this is one that i use) it\u2019s packed with a multi-peptide complex, hyaluronic acid, and soothing plant extracts like ginkgo leaf and aloe. It\u2019s designed to hydrate, smooth fine lines, and strengthen your skin barrier without causing breakouts.\n\nOther great peptide-based or barrier-supporting alternatives:\n\n\\- Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer \u2013 affordable, lightweight, great for sensitive or acne-prone skin.\n\n\\- The Inkey List Omega Water Cream \u2013 super light, nice for layering with actives, and keeps skin calm.\n\n\\- NIOD Copper Amino Isolate Serum 2:1 \u2013 more of a splurge, but amazing for overall skin health and resilience.\n\nThen 2\u20133x/week (not the same night as peptides), you can rotate in a BHA (like your Paula\u2019s Choice) or a gentle AHA like mandelic acid to keep pores clear and skin smooth.\n\nThe key is to not overload your routine, let each active have its night to shine. Peptides most nights, exfoliants a couple times a week, and always follow with moisturizer to seal it all in."}

We both know how cause and effect work and so Hamas must be a result of what happened before they existed.\n\nAnd yes as occupied people they have the right to resist.\nThat doesn't mean they have the right to commit war crimes just as Isra\u00ebl doesn't.

Meine damalige Freundin und heutige Ehefrau hatte dunkelblonde Taillenlange Haare bei unserem Kennenlernen . Im September des gleichen Jahres war sie am Wochenende bei Ihrer Freundin zu Besuch und M\u00e4delsabend machen .Zu diesem Zeitpunkt wusste sie , da\u00df ich total vernarrt war in Ihr Haar und freute sich \u00fcber die Komplimente meinerseits sowie von aussenstehenden Menschen . Da meine Freundin meist einen Bolero trug waren die langen Haare meist darunter versteckt . So auch an diesem Sonntag als wir uns Nachmittags trafen . Wie immer gingen wir aufeinander zu , k\u00fcssten uns und meine H\u00e4nde gingen in ihren Nacken damit ich ihr Haar aus dem Bolero ziehen konnte . Doch dann stockte mir der Atem , als nach 10 Zentimetern kein Haar mehr \u00fcber meine Finger glitt . Bist du mir jetzt b\u00f6se,  war die furchtbarste Frage die sie mir dann stellte . Viele werden jetzt lachen aber ich fing an zu heulen , weil ich es nicht fassen konnte . Im gleichen Moment kamen die Bilder von Steffi wieder bei mir hoch . Ich verstand die Welt nicht mehr und verabschiedete mich bis zum anderen Tag von ihr und ging  mit tr\u00e4nenden Augen nach Hause . Am n\u00e4chsten Tag erkl\u00e4rte sie mir dann wie es zu den kurzen Haaren kam . Sie waren zu viert an dem Abend und zwei von Ihnen kamen dann auf die Idee mit dem Haare schneiden . Nach Aussage meiner Freundin wollten alle sich gegenseitig die Spitzen um 5 Zentimeter k\u00fcrzen,  was sie dann auch durchgezogen haben . Dann wollte eine noch mal 5 Zentimeter k\u00fcrzer haben , wenn die anderen mitziehen w\u00fcrden.  Also machten sie das auch noch . Dann schlug wiederum die andere vor das sich alle vier die gleiche L\u00e4nge schneiden lassen um zu sehen , welche ihr Haar am schnellsten w\u00e4chst . Die k\u00fcrzesten Haare hatte die beste Freundin meiner Frau . Und nicht als Spielverderber oder Looserin da zu stehen willigte meine Frau auch da ein . Ende vom Lied war das besagte Ergebnis von knapp \u00fcber der Schulterblattl\u00e4nge. Ich liebte meine Frau nicht wegen ihrer langen Haare aber es fehlte etwas , das war nicht mehr sie , zumal sie ihr Haar immer gepflegt und gehegt hat . Ich lass sie wieder wachsen , so ihre Aussage und du darfst die L\u00e4nge bestimmen , das dir das so nah geht konnte ich ja nicht ahnen , aber am Stei\u00dfbein ist Schluss,  l\u00e4nger hatte ich sie schon aber das gefiel mir nicht und ich hatte sie 2 Wochen bevor wir zusammen gekommen sind erst abschneiden lassen . Wie schon gesagt ich liebte meine Frau und nur ich durfte dann ihr Haar schneiden , das ist bis heute so nach 43 Jahren ."}

It\u2019s horribly complex, but I think a worthy exercise of my time, at least. \n\nI\u2019d postulate that part of the agreement in the transfer would have to be allowing people who married in to indigenous families to be considered citizens or green card holders. And anyone born to an indigenous family would have that birthright.\n\nI\u2019m mixed too. Half French/quarter Scot/quarter Ashkenazi. My family came here 110 years ago. Where would I go? We\u2019d have to come to some agreement on possible futures for emigrants. I feel like it\u2019d end up with people being able to choose based on their heritage. \n\n\nHow many years do you think it\u2019d take for the burden to not overwhelm receiving countries?"}

Como digo, no es cosa de contenerse, ni siquiera implica un esfuerzo, simplemente no genera atracci\u00f3n sexual de ninguna manera, porque no me va a atraer cualquier por simplemente ser mujer.\nEs verdad que solo podemos asegurar que es lo normal dentro de nuestro c\u00edrculo, pero simplificar las relaciones de amistad omitiendo todos los factores psicol\u00f3gicos y asumir que el impulso sexual es determinante para cualquier persona en cualquiera de sus relaciones es una idea err\u00f3nea."}

If you mean \"The Earth is flat and there are lizard people\", of course not, but \"JFK assassination was fishy\" is not at all an outlandish take, f.e. famous commie Michael Parenti spoke a bit about it and pushed back anti-conspiracy narratives by Chomsky. \n\nIt is simply in the interest of the bourgeoisie to collude with each other. That's how we get stuff like Bilderberg and Le Cercle or Bohemian Grove and yes, sometimes also Freemasonry (look at P2 Lodge in Italy). Doesn't mean they drink children's blood (or do they??), just a bunch of old farts sitting around a table drinking coffee deciding policy, what story to spread in the media, etc... In fact, I would say leftists point this out way too little. These are very real ways we can glimpse bourgeoisie class solidarity. Look how they fucked Corbyn in the UK. Clearly a completely coordinated smear operation. \n\nThen the bourgeoisie also fight a lot amongst each other, in open war of course, but also with subterfuge, and that's how we get these endless rabbit hole events, like JFK, Watergate, Epstein scandal. Then there was their fight against communism in the cold war and all the really dark shit associated with this, all the coups, Gladio, MKUltra ,etc. I wonder how can you be a leftist and not a conspiracy theorist?\n\nFinally, there is the real shizo shit which is kinda in the middle between a 100% confirmed conspiracy like Operation Condor and 100% fantasy like lizard people. I am mainly talking about the idea of secret pedo networks amongst the elite. Will we on the r/trueanon subreddit really say these don't exist? We know about Epstein anyway, but I mean stuff like the Franklin scandal. Is it really that outlandish that there are more sexual sadists, pedos and general sickos amongst the elite than the normal population, and, since they have the material means to cover up their actions, these would find each other and form their own little circles? I think not. I think all the stuff about satanism, child abuse, drinking children's blood, dressing up funny,  they may as well all do it. A shared crime grows class solidarity. And who's gonna believe the victims anyway."}

Layering in the fees due at inception, you are then left with the net of the rebate that gets applied to cap cost.\n\nThink about it this way. One side of the equation is total due at signing. This includes rebates and cash due at signing. The other side is use of this cash. This would include cap cost reduction, acquisition fee, dealer fees, add ons, title fees and any other fees rolled into upfront. The cap cost reduction is the remainder after all the fees are factored in. So it will always be less than 12,500 when applied to cap cost reduction. Unless you put enough DAS in cash to cover the rest of the items."}

Once it prints any <name>: line, that part is deleted and the generation stopped. \n\nYou can optionally let either: \n\na. randomness (or a 'shyness' parameter) decide who speaks next.   \nb. The model itself suggest who speaks next (useful with a thinking model).   \nc. The user decide who's next. \n\nIt works better with a 'Narrator'  character that handles any actions/events not attributable to a single character. It may take some editing to get the model into the flow, but once you have a couple thousand tokens of good data, it can continue the pattern.   \n  \nTo get a real immersive experience, allow the user to hide text from particular characters (because they aren't there, or can't experience what's happening for whatever reason). Alt-replies would be neat too (for cases where there are in-story language barriers, so hide just what's being said). AI is notoriously bad at not 'mind-reading'."}

Even just walking in the pool will be easier and you can keep moving for longer. If your legs tire out, most gyms should have some sort of paddle weights so you can float on your back and get movement in your arms. \n\nAnd if you haven't swam in a long time or never swam, one thing to remember is that fat people float. So if you ever slip or can't touch the bottom or get tired, just lay back and catch your breath. \n\n\n\n\nMy brother lost almost 60lbs in 6 weeks by doing this.

Millions, tens of millions, replacing every truck driver with a robot would cause 3 million people to be unemployed in the US alone overnight.\n\nPlus not everyone wants a bachelors degree or wnats to work in jobs taht require it or even can, there are people who aren't suited for higher education be it they don't enjoy it, are too stupid to be blunt about it or just don't fit in the environment.\n\nYou have a and this is not meant as an insult just an observation, simplistic and idealistic view of the world.these low paying jobs still give people meaning and something to do some people even like these jobs, few they may be depending on the job. But overall your utopia sint a utopia it's a horror how of either manipulated people or a hell hole of debauchery, boredom and useless people.\n\nLet me.explain it to you in this way, robots are one of the worst threats to humanity not because ether will kill us but make enough of us ibsulete taht we will see violence and unrest on a scale not seen in history. Do you know who is responsible for most violent uprising and rise of violent groups in history? Young, unemployed, bored men and women for that matter but young bored unemployed women don't tend to join openly violent groups, they join other groups taht lead to social unrest. Your idea will either require to suppress everyone who has no job and feels useless or it will be a terrible boring life that you fill with useless chap to feel anything at all."}
