No story, no narrative, just a document talking about a haunted object or creature. \n\nBut it's not like the addition of a narrative takes away anything. If anything it just makes it better. I'd get really bored of SCP if all it was just thousands of stale, clinical documents describing spooky things with no narrative at all. \n\nMaybe this sounds conceited of me, but the best explanation I can come up with is that as SCP gets more complex and dense, the more 'simple minded' folk have a hard time wrapping their head around it. It's like, they can read a short document talking about a weird statue that snaps your neck, but they can't digest an hour-long short story, possibly with lots of techno-jargon and more subtle hints about the actual nature of the SCP."}

But there were so many elements that could\u2019ve easily spooked him and caused this to go wrong. Kaylee in Maddie\u2019s bed, Xana awake and ordering food meaning another car/witness on the property, Dylan getting out of her room and yelling, Murphy barking, all the lights on. Plus I remember reports of a neighbor out in his yard and also some sort of underage drinking party in a nearby field being busted by the cops just a couple hours before so cops would\u2019ve been around just a few hours prior. I know it\u2019s not much solace but the only silver lining is that whatever fantasy the killer had about what this night would\u2019ve felt like for him didn\u2019t come to fruition with all the different stressors that night."}

Do the best you can. \n\nI was a math and science teacher at a title one middle school for 11 years. Our district has a program called the New Arrival Center for kids who sometimes literally just walked across the border. I was struggling with my regular classes and they decided it would be a good idea for me to teach math and science to the New Arrival Center students. Mind you these were students from Mexico, Central America, Viet Nam, France, and Sudan ages 11-16. \n\nLike you I freaked out but was told focus on language skills and work in a little science and math. OK, we made lots of posters and collages to learn English words. The math was OK as most were better than American students and the science was fun. Our district had great support for this program with a formal curriculum. It was fantastic! When those kiddos left after 1 year in the New Arrival Center, they were just as successful as native students in upper grades. What I thought was a nightmare turned out to be a blessing. \n\nTake a deep breath and give yourself a break. Talk with your director of instruction and see what her/his expectations are of these students. You may find it to be one of the better gigs in the school.\n\nAs far as quiting now, I don't recommend it. You haven't really given it a chance. I think you are panicked and just want to get out. Take a deep breath and go in with zero expectations. Don't worry about getting fired and just do what you can."}

No, not one,\" the angel Gabriel confirmed. \"But, peace deal or no, God in his love and mercy has agreed to let Trump into Heaven all the same, if he will only repent and trust in the finished work of Jesus Christ. The Lord's grace is sufficient.\"\n\n>Heavenly sources confirmed that no one throughout history who trusted in their own goodness has been able to enter the presence of the Holy of Holies. \"We're still sitting at zero on that one,\" said Heavenly resident Arthur Gonce. \"Yet, God has made a way nonetheless. Believe me, the saints are cheering for Trump and for every sinner to repent and throw themselves on the mercy of Christ.\"\n\n>At publishing time, reliable sources had confirmed that the Lord's offer was available, at this very moment, to all mankind."}

In software (SemVer), the dots aren\u2019t decimal points, they\u2019re separators for MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Versions are compared left-to-right numerically by each field, so 0.10.0 > 0.9.9 because 10 (minor) is greater than 9. No \u201cbad math,\u201d just different rules than decimals.  \ufffc\n\nThis is normal across the industry. Plenty of projects went 1.9 \u2192 1.10 and people freaked out the same way back then; it\u2019s standard versioning, not a math error.  \ufffc\n\nAnd specifically for openpilot: comma\u2019s own blog literally says \u201cafter 0.9 we welcome you to the 0.10 series.\u201d They chose to keep major = 0 and bump the minor from 9 to 10, which is exactly how SemVer works during the <1.0 phase.  \ufffc\n\nTL;DR: 0.10 is the next minor after 0.9.x, not \u201c0.1\u201d. It doesn\u2019t need to be \u201c0.91\u201d or \u201c0.99\u201d. The SemVer guidance for the 0.y.z phase is to keep bumping the minor as you iterate, and move to 1.0 when you want to signal maturity.

Hard to say, could just be truly dogshit matchmaking, but Netease engineers [have given presentations where they talk about using EOMM](https://gdcvault.com/play/1027278/Find-the-Right-Match-AI) (they admit to giving higher odds to players who are likely to stop playing in order to reduce churn, about the halfway mark) \n\nHere's [a comment from shortly after launch](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1ia43cv/comment/m9cq3x9/) which does a good job summarizing all the ways Netease has admitted to using EOMM in the past. \n\nAnd that's not even speaking of how the rank system is clearly designed to keep players playing as many matches as possible, with not only regular rank resets and no placement matches, but also the ability to gain ELO with a negative WR, which is how you get 45% WR players in GM after they grind 600 matches. \n\nAll of that in my book adds up to clear use of multiple forms of EOMM. \n\nYou can believe Netease when they say they don't use EOMM, but ALL of the actual evidence points to the opposite."}

Imagine it being like rubbing your belly after a big meal.\n\nBeak grinding - sign of content and happiness. \n\nStanding on one leg, sometimes puffed up feathers - getting ready to snooze, they'll sleep with the head tucked in their back.\n\nFlapping randomly or madly but not flying - just being a goof!\n\nBending over, making a squeaky noise and trembling wings - horny bird! Check Cockatiel Cottage for how to deal with hormonal behavior.\n\nRubbing butt on things - same as above.\n\nSoft eeee sound with head bobbing - baby begging noises. Can mean that they want food/play/nap/reassurance/cuddles. Some older birds will do this too. \n\nHolding the wings away from the body (\"heart wings\") - a happy male, likely about to sing to you.\n\nFully outstretched wings (\"big wings\") - possesive, \"the thing I'm standing on is mine\". Sometimes paired with hanging upside down (\"batbird\") - that's also just being a goof.\n\nFluffing feathers, bending in weird poses with open wings - wants a bath!\n\nSneezing - normal (unless excessive), especially after scratching their heads and picking their nose (yes, they do that).\n\n***\n\nAdditionally, check out these resources: \n\nThere are lots of toys and foraging opportunities that you can make from cardboard, toilet paper tubes, foliage from your yard (check the species for toxicity [here](https://birdhism.com/blogs/news/common-bird-safe-house-plants) and [here](https://mdvaden.com/bird_page.shtml)).

Maybe it\u2019ll lower your monthly payment. But let\u2019s be real: there is no actual path to paying this off if you're already struggling. None. Your payments won\u2019t even touch the interest, and that unpaid interest will get tacked onto your principal and snowball into an even bigger mountain of debt. Your balance will go *up*, not down. It\u2019s not just predatory, it\u2019s legalized usury, plain and simple.\n\nAnd forget about forgiveness. That\u2019s about as realistic as this country ever implementing universal healthcare. Why do you think they\u2019re pumping record funding into \"Cop City\" projects and expanding ICE with budgets that dwarf the military spending of entire nations? You really think that\u2019s about \u201cillegals\u201d and crime and safety? No dude, it\u2019s about laying the groundwork for a domestic police state to suppress unrest when the economic screws turn too tight. And guess what? Those screws are tightening. Student loan debt is at historic highs, and the default wave is coming.\n\nRight now, your only real goal should be survival. Get on an income-driven plan if you can. If the payment\u2019s still too high, just pay *something,* anything, to avoid default. It won\u2019t stop the interest from piling up, but at least it might buy you some time. Maybe if things improve and you land a better-paying job that lets you make larger payments to keep the balance from exploding.\n\nI hate to sound apocalyptic, but people need to stop sugarcoating this. The situation is dire, and the so-called \u201csolutions\u201d are nothing more than smoke and mirrors. The BBB didn\u2019t fix the student loan crisis, it threw gasoline on it."}

{"created_at": "2025-08-22T05:34:14Z", "text": "Would you say this to yourself if you were 1-2 levels below your current position? I think not everyone cares to continually progress in their own career (they are happy at their current level). But if you are at a very low level and want to take on more responsibility, but can\u2019t because of hiring freezes, lack of competitions for that level etc\u2026 then you might feel frustrated with your career situation. Some might see their identity as having a desire to contribute to the world/community/workplace in a certain way. If you feel stifled by the opportunities available to you, and unable to work at the level you want, then it can be frustrating.\n\nMost people I have seen that feel that their job and identities are intertwined are not necessarily concerned about AI. The \u201cconcerned about AI\u201d group is most likely concerned they will lose their job (source of income), not that a source of their identity is about to disappear. People are rightly allowed to be skeptical if their livelihood is under threat.\n\nI think you touched on a few facets of attitudes in the workplace. One thing I see as true is that we are constantly being expected to get training (respect in the workplace, job-specific continuing education). Some of that makes sense- if you don\u2019t keep reinforcing values like respect towards coworkers then you might lose that workplace cultural norm over time. But for some of my colleagues that have 20+ years of experience in the same position, I think they do run out of training to have in their annual performance agreements. As long as they are working at the expected level (and hopefully passing on knowledge to newer employees) I don\u2019t see a problem, to a certain degree. As long as they are open to the position evolving over time."}

I am glad you got out of it and I'm are taking care of yourself! It's just a matter of time for me. Knowing this is not a permanent situation helps me.\n\nI would believe your ex boss is a psychopath too. I looked up the characteristics on google. Out of the listed 10 characteristics of a psychopath, the leader of the pack for me has eight. You said it so well. Healthy human beings do not take joy in hurting other people. And I have watched mine be gleeful about it. It is quite a thing to behold. The worst of the worst. Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. \n\nThe saddest thing is that they seem to have no conscience and no empathy and so they will never understand their own depravity. That's pretty pathetic. That thought sustains me quite well. Surely all the damage they do will one day come back on them and by then, I hope I am long gone."}
